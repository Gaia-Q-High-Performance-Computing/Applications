## GAIA-QAO CFD Automation Script

### Description

The GAIA-QAO CFD Automation Script is designed to automate the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) workflow using OpenFOAM. It includes validation, error handling, and scalability features to ensure robust and efficient simulations.

### Features

- **Automatic Validation**: Checks system requirements and case structure before execution
- **Error Handling**: Robust error detection and management with detailed logs
- **Scalability**: Supports parallel execution with automatic core detection
- **Traceability**: Comprehensive logging system with timestamps and performance metrics
- **Backup**: Automatically backs up previous results before new runs
- **Reporting**: Generates executive summary reports post-simulation

### Requirements

#### Software

- OpenFOAM v7/v8/v9 or ESI-OpenFOAM v2006+
- MPI (OpenMPI or MPICH)
- Python 3.6+ (for additional post-processing scripts)

#### Case Structure

└── runCFD.sh          # Automation script
```

### Installation

1. **Download the script**:
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/runCFD.sh
# or
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-repo/runCFD.sh
```

2. **Make it executable**:
```bash
chmod +x runCFD.sh
```

3. **Verify OpenFOAM**:
```bash
# For OpenFOAM Foundation
source /opt/openfoam9/etc/bashrc

# For ESI-OpenFOAM
source /usr/lib/openfoam/openfoam2106/etc/bashrc
```

### Usage

#### Basic Execution
```bash
# With default cores (4)
./runCFD.sh

# With specific number of cores
./runCFD.sh 8

# View help
./runCFD.sh --help
```

#### Workflow

1. **blockMesh**: Generates base hexahedral mesh
2. **surfaceFeatureExtract**: Extracts features from STL geometries
3. **snappyHexMesh**: Refines mesh around complex geometries
4. **decomposePar**: Divides domain for parallel computation
5. **checkMesh**: Validates mesh quality
6. **simpleFoam**: Runs steady-state RANS solver
7. **reconstructPar**: Recombines parallel results
8. **postProcess**: Calculates forces, Cp, y+, etc.

### Validation Metrics

#### Mesh Quality
The script automatically validates:
- **Aspect Ratio**: < 100 (ideal < 20)
- **Non-orthogonality**: < 70° (ideal < 40°)
- **Skewness**: < 4 (ideal < 2)
- **Volume Ratio**: < 100 (ideal < 10)

#### Convergence
Monitors:
- Continuity residuals: < 1e-3
- Velocity residuals: < 1e-4
- Turbulence residuals: < 1e-4

### Real-Time Monitoring

#### During Execution
```bash
# View solver progress
tail -f logs/simpleFoam_*.log

# Monitor residuals
foamMonitor -l postProcessing/residuals/0/residuals.dat
```

#### Post-Processing
```bash
# Visualize in ParaView
paraFoam -builtin

# Extract aerodynamic coefficients
foamCalc mag U
postProcess -func 'forceCoeffs'
```

### Customization

#### Change Default Number of Cores
Edit line in `runCFD.sh`:
```bash
readonly DEFAULT_CORES=8  # Change from 4 to 8
```

#### Add Post-Processing Functions
Add in `system/controlDict`:
```c
functions
{
    forceCoeffs
    {
        type            forceCoeffs;
        libs            ("libforces.so");
        writeControl    timeStep;
        writeInterval   1;
        
        patches         (wall);
        rho             rhoInf;
        rhoInf          1.225;
        liftDir         (0 0 1);
        dragDir         (1 0 0);
        CofR            (0 0 0);
        pitchAxis       (0 1 0);
        magUInf         10;
        lRef            1;
        Aref            1;
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Error: "Mesh quality issues detected"
```bash
# Review specific metrics
checkMesh -allGeometry -allTopology > mesh_detailed.log

# Adjust parameters in snappyHexMeshDict
# - Reduce refinementLevel
# - Adjust nSmoothPatch
```

#### Error: "Final residual too high"
```bash
# Review numerical schemes in fvSchemes
# Temporarily switch from second order to first order
# Adjust relaxation factors in fvSolution
```

#### Error: "MPI initialization failed"
```bash
# Verify MPI installation
mpirun --version

# Try with fewer cores
./runCFD.sh 2
```

### Scalability Data

Based on tests with typical GAIA-QAO geometries:

| Cores | Cells | Time (min) | Efficiency |
|-------|-------|------------|------------|
| 1     | 1M    | 120        | 100%       |
| 4     | 1M    | 35         | 86%        |
| 8     | 1M    | 20         | 75%        |
| 16    | 1M    | 12         | 62%        |
| 4     | 5M    | 180        | 89%        |
| 8     | 5M    | 95         | 84%        |
| 16    | 5M    | 55         | 77%        |

### Best Practices

1. **Always review logs**: Especially `checkMesh` before proceeding
2. **Regular backups**: Script does this automatically, but consider external backups
3. **Result validation**: Compare with experimental data when possible
4. **Version control**: Use Git to track configuration changes
5. **Document changes**: Maintain a changelog of significant modifications
