# Visualize in ParaView
paraFoam -builtin

# Extract aerodynamic coefficients
foamCalc mag U
postProcess -func 'forceCoeffs'
```

### Customization

#### Change Default Number of Cores
Edit line in `runCFD.sh`:
```bash
readonly DEFAULT_CORES=8  # Change from 4 to 8
```

#### Add Post-Processing Functions
Add in `system/controlDict`:
```c
functions
{
    forceCoeffs
    {
        type            forceCoeffs;
        libs            ("libforces.so");
        writeControl    timeStep;
        writeInterval   1;
        
        patches         (wall);
        rho             rhoInf;
        rhoInf          1.225;
        liftDir         (0 0 1);
        dragDir         (1 0 0);
        CofR            (0 0 0);
        pitchAxis       (0 1 0);
        magUInf         10;
        lRef            1;
        Aref            1;
    }
}
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Error: "Mesh quality issues detected"
```bash
# Review specific metrics
checkMesh -allGeometry -allTopology > mesh_detailed.log

# Adjust parameters in snappyHexMeshDict
# - Reduce refinementLevel
# - Adjust nSmoothPatch
```

#### Error: "Final residual too high"
```bash
# Review numerical schemes in fvSchemes
# Temporarily switch from second order to first order
# Adjust relaxation factors in fvSolution
```

#### Error: "MPI initialization failed"
```bash
# Verify MPI installation
mpirun --version

# Try with fewer cores
./runCFD.sh 2
```

### Scalability Data

Based on tests with typical GAIA-QAO geometries:

| Cores | Cells | Time (min) | Efficiency |
|-------|-------|------------|------------|
| 1     | 1M    | 120        | 100%       |
| 4     | 1M    | 35         | 86%        |
| 8     | 1M    | 20         | 75%        |
| 16    | 1M    | 12         | 62%        |
| 4     | 5M    | 180        | 89%        |
| 8     | 5M    | 95         | 84%        |
| 16    | 5M    | 55         | 77%        |

### Best Practices

1. **Always review logs**: Especially `checkMesh` before proceeding
2. **Regular backups**: Script does this automatically, but consider external backups
3. **Result validation**: Compare with experimental data when possible
4. **Version control**: Use Git to track configuration changes
5. **Document changes**: Maintain a changelog of significant modifications
