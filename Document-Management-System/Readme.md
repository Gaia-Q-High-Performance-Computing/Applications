**Document:** `GAIA-QAO-SPEC-DMS-2025-001.yaml`  
**Title:** AI-Driven Document Management System (DMS) Integration for Ampel360 BWB Q100 Certification  
**Version:** 0.7  
**Status:** DRAFT  
**Classification:** INTERNAL  
**InfoCode:** GP-QAO-DMS-CERT-001

---

## Overview

This specification defines the authoritative, AI-enhanced Document Management System (DMS) for the **Ampel360 BWB Q100** aircraft certification program. The DMS provides a secure, audit-traceable repository for all certification artifacts, technical documentation, quantum evidence, and compliance data. It is designed to support the seamless integration of engineering, quantum, and digital twin assets with full EASA/FAA certification traceability.

---

## Key Features

- **Audit-Traceable Repository:**  
  Every certification artifact is versioned and mapped to requirements, supporting certification and operational audit needs.

- **Quantum Documentation Ready:**  
  Native management of quantum algorithm specs, quantum-classical interfaces, and verification evidence.

- **Digital Twin Integration:**  
  Link simulation and as-built data to the document chain for model-based certification and operational traceability.

- **AI-Driven Workflows:**  
  Automated classification, compliance checking, reviewer routing, and anomaly/gap detection.

- **Security & Access Control:**  
  End-to-end encryption, MFA, HSM, secure enclaves, DLP, and granular role-based permissions for all documentation.

## Documentation Hierarchy

Follows major EASA/FAA structures and quantum-enabled extensions:
- Type Certificate Data Sheet (TC)
- Certification Program (CP)
- Compliance Documentation (CD)
- System Safety Assessment (SSA)
- Test Docs/Means of Compliance/Reports (TD/MoC/CR)
- Analysis, FMEA, FHA, CCA
- Quantum System/Algorithm/Verification/Interface Docs (QSD, QSpec, QVE, QCID)
- Digital Twin Docs (DTDoc, ModelSpec, SimRes, ValRep)
- ...and more

For a detailed hierarchy, see the [YAML specification](./GAIA-QAO-SPEC-DMS-2025-001.yaml).
