# AI System Implementation Roadmap

This document outlines a phased approach for building a functional AI system that supports advanced aerospace applications such as the zero-impact turbofan concept. It complements the overall GAIA-QAO architecture and aligns with standards-driven development practices.

## 1. Define System Requirements
- Capture functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, safety, and certification objectives.
- Identify data sources (sensors, simulation outputs, operational logs) and expected data volumes.
- Establish interfaces with existing GAIA-QAO modules, such as CFD, optimization, and digital twins.

## 2. Establish Data Infrastructure
- Set up secure data pipelines and storage solutions for incoming sensor data and simulation results.
- Implement data quality checks and retention policies consistent with GAIA-QAO documentation standards.
- Prepare a knowledge graph for tracking component histories and blockchain-based material passports.

## 3. Develop Core AI Services
- Create modular services for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
- Leverage quantum-enhanced algorithms from the Q-AI layer where applicable.
- Integrate health monitoring and predictive maintenance models for real-time operation.

## 4. Integrate Edge Computing
- Deploy lightweight inference components on embedded devices for low-latency control tasks.
- Provide mechanisms for synchronization between onboard models and centralized training pipelines.

## 5. Implement Control and Feedback Loops
- Connect AI-driven controllers to engine actuators such as adaptive bypass mechanisms and magnetic bearings.
- Collect telemetry to continuously update models and refine performance.

## 6. Verification and Certification
- Use the DO-178C compliance matrix as guidance for software development and testing.
- Document verification evidence and maintain traceability across requirements, tests, and artifacts.

## 7. Deployment and Monitoring
- Deploy services to production environments with automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Monitor system performance, log anomalies, and trigger corrective actions when necessary.

## 8. Continuous Improvement
- Periodically retrain models using new operational data.
- Assess emerging technologies (e.g., quantum-classical interfaces) for future integration.

This roadmap provides a high-level structure for building a robust AI system that can adapt to complex aerospace applications while maintaining compliance with industry standards.
